# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #5

## Title
Windows complex application.

## Contents
- Collaboration
- All previously studied things

## Mandatory Objectives
- Create an application which has:
- Child windows controls
- GDI animation
- Animation should be controlled by controls

## Objectives With Points (completed)
- Work on this project in a team of 2-4 (2 pt)
- Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) (1 pt)
- Make it useful (you may ask me to evaluate usefulness of your application idea) (0-3 pt)
- First create a sketch, then work on code (1 pt) (commit sketches early)

## Application Capitan Bumbu battle - ship

## Application Tasks
- Create a mockup
- Create class BattleGrid
- Create AI for BattleGrid
- Implement Drawing the grid with ships (enemy / friend)
- Implement attacking the enemy
- Implement randomizer of the ships on grid
- Create the bitmaps for the ships
- Implement attacking the capitan-bumbu

## Usefullness
The application is usefull for killeing time. Besides the classic game features it has something special. And this is that there is a cell where your capitan is. An if you hit the capitan you win the game instantly. :D

## Conclusion
The laboratory work was very interesting because we worked in a team. Due to the lack of free time the process of program creation took a little more time than expected.

The encountered problems were solved also in the team, and improved a lot the whole productivity, so the process was more motivating.
The task management was very useful and worked like a charm for us.


The team consisted of : Eugen Ungureanu, Mihai Iachimovschi, Serigu Terman.
